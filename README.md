Namaste 🙏 NodeJs is a playlist by Akshay Saini. These are the notes I've made when I was learning NodeJs from Scratch using the playlist.

# 📘 Node.js - Chapter 1: Introduction (Quick Notes)
🧠 Run JavaScript everywhere, not just in browsers
⚙️ JS Runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine
🌐 Cross-platform & open-source
🏢 Maintained by OpenJS Foundation
🌍 Executes JS outside the web browser
🔁 Uses event-driven & non-blocking (async) I/O
👨‍💻 Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009

# 🛠️ The Journey
- JS always needs a JS engine to run
- Initially used SpiderMonkey (Firefox), then V8 (Chrome)
- Ryan worked with Joyent, named it web.js at first
- Built Node.js to improve over blocking servers like Apache
- First built for Mac/Linux, Windows support came in 2011
- In 2012, Isaac (creator of npm) took over
- 2014, fork called io.js was made by Fedor
- In 2015, Node.js & io.js merged
- In 2019, JS Foundation + Node.js Foundation = OpenJS Foundation
